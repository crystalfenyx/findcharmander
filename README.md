# findcharmander / A simple JavaScript game. Avoid the wild Pidgeys!

1. I liked the possibility of creating a simple game using JavaScript. I changed the naming slightly to finding a Pokemon (Charmander) in a field of grass (very commonly in Pokemon games). The Pokemon Trainer has to avoid encountering wild Pidgeys (common annoyances in the Pokemon games) as he passes through the field to find the Charmander. I also changed the keys to W(up), S(down), A(left) and D(right).
2. I was still a bit unsure on how to apply many concepts learnt though I did do revision. I did reference an existing solution of the Colmar Academy project to help me, but I wrote all my code and commented them with my understanding. I didn't really understand still what the print() was doing in the game though, and I also didn't know how to use the package to clear the field. I felt this was a good formative assessment for me but not necessarily a summative one. I still need to revise a lot of JavaScript more. I also struggled at first with keeping track of closing curly braces, but later found that commenting them really helped me.
3. More mini-assignments or practices on JavaScript problems which show what can be done with JS.
