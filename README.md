# findcharmander

1. I liked the possibility of creating a simple game using JavaScript.
2. I was still a bit unsure on how to apply many concepts learnt though I did do revision. I did reference an existing solution of the Colmar Academy project to help me, but I wrote all my code and commented them with my understanding. I didn't really understand still what the print() was doing in the game though. I felt this was a good formative assessment for me but not necessarily a summative one. I still need to revise a lot of JavaScript more.
3. More mini-assignments or practices on JavaScript problems which show what can be done with JS.
